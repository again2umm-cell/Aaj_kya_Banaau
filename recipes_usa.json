    ],
    "requiredIngredients": ["chicken pieces", "buttermilk", "flour", "oil", "seasoning salt"],
    "instructions": [
      "Brine the Chicken: In a large bowl or zip-top bag, combine the buttermilk, hot sauce, garlic powder, and salt. Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully submerged. Marinate in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours, or preferably overnight (up to 24 hours).",
      "Prepare Coating: In a large, shallow dish or paper bag, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, seasoning salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne pepper.",
      "Dredge the Chicken: Remove chicken from the buttermilk, allowing excess liquid to drip off. Working one piece at a time, dredge the chicken firmly in the flour mixture, ensuring a thick, even coating. For an extra craggy crust, briefly dip the piece back into the buttermilk and dredge again in the flour (double-dredging).",
      "Rest: Place the coated chicken pieces on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Let them rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This allows the coating to adhere and prevents it from falling off during frying.",
      "Fry the Chicken: Pour oil into a deep cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven to a depth of 1 to 1.5 inches. Heat the oil to **325-350°F (160-175°C)**. Maintain this temperature using a thermometer.",
      "Cook: Carefully place 3-4 chicken pieces in the hot oil (do not overcrowd). Fry the chicken, turning occasionally, until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches **165°F (74°C)** (dark meat takes longer, about 15-20 minutes total).",
      "Drain: Remove the chicken and place it on a clean wire rack over a baking sheet (not directly on paper towels, which can make the bottom crust soggy). Serve hot."
